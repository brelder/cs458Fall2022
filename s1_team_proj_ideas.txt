Project Ideas:

Portales Theater App: For last semester, our team developed a website that can manage the registration of users, 
so they can purchase tickets and select seats for plays on a “Theater in Los Portales”.
This idea is a continuation of that project by designing an android application for the Theater System so users can easily register, 
sign in and purchase their tickets from an app designed specifically for mobile.

LinguaReader: A eBook reader to assist language learners by providing a simplistic way 
to look-up words with a touch of their finger and having the ability to save those same words in the same app, 
so they can review later in a flashcard system that utilizes space repetition to make easier the arduous task of 
remembering new words in a foreign language. 


Dog Shelter App: By filling out a questionnaire, the app shows the “perfect” selection of dogs based on the answers the user has given.
It will include also all the current dogs available and an about us page.

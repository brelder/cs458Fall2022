# cs458Fall2022 - Los Portales Theatre App
Team Project for Mobile Application Development.

For this semester, we have build an app from scratch based on a website we did for CS472. 

The repository for that project can be found here [Los Portales Theatre web](https://github.com/damiansh/Project-Theater).

However in this repository, under source code you can find the the updated code for the website, as we created APIs to interact with the android app. 

A live version of the web can be found [here](https://portales-theatre.site/)
